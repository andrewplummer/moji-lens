Japanese websites frequently render text as images — both in <img> tags and CSS background-images. This makes the text completely invisible to Ctrl+F. Moji Lens fixes that.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Visit any webpage — Moji Lens automatically detects Japanese text and counts images on the page
2. Click the extension icon and hit "Scan Page"
3. Every image is sent to Claude Vision AI for accurate Japanese OCR
4. Extracted text appears directly on the page, right below each image
5. Use Ctrl+F to search — it just works

FEATURES

• Accurate Japanese OCR powered by Claude Vision (Haiku) — far superior to traditional OCR for Japanese text
• Detects both <img> tags and CSS background-image elements
• Smart caching — images are cached by URL so repeat scans and shared assets across pages cost nothing
• Works on any website — content script runs on all pages, scans only when you ask
• Visible OCR results — extracted text appears as small labeled annotations below each image, with native Ctrl+F highlighting
• Handles float/flex/grid layouts — OCR labels adapt to the page layout without breaking it
• Progress tracking — real-time progress in the badge and popup, persists if you close and reopen the popup
• Clear error messages — API issues (insufficient credits, invalid key) are surfaced in the popup, not buried in the console

SETUP

1. Get an API key at console.anthropic.com
2. Paste it into the Moji Lens settings
3. Start scanning

Cost is minimal — Claude Haiku is extremely affordable, and Moji Lens caches every result so the same image is never processed twice.

PRIVACY

• Your API key is stored locally in your browser and never sent anywhere except directly to the Anthropic API
• Images are sent to the Anthropic API only when you explicitly click "Scan Page" — never automatically
• No analytics, no tracking, no data collection by the extension itself
• Full privacy policy: [YOUR_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL]

BUILT WITH AI

This extension was built entirely by Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) in collaboration with a human developer. From architecture to implementation to this store listing — every line of code was written by Claude.

OPEN SOURCE

Source code is available for inspection. No obfuscation, no minification, no bundlers — just clean, readable JavaScript.
